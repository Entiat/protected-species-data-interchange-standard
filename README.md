Protected Species Data Interchange Standard

## Abstract

The Protected Species GeoJSON Standard is a geospatial data interchange format that extends GeoJSON [[RFC7946](<https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946>)] to support sharing and dissemination of data specific to operations (including but not limited to legal compliance and mitigation), and research around protected animal species. Typical data includes information about whales, dolphins, pinnipeds, sea turtles, polar bears, fisheries, avian, and terrestrial animals. Meta-data formats are  also specified, including information about observational effort, mitigation actions, behavioral observations, vehicle tracks, and a the types/methods of animal detections, and observation technology used.

## Status 

Just starting. I'm writing the initial document (latest updates found in this repo) that will eventually become an IETC RFC. Someday.

## Up Next

Once I'm happy with this, I'll start reaching out to select people for feedback. Once they're happy, we submit it to the IETC and see where that goes.

## I'm full of ideas, lemme help!

Cool, but note this is just (now - August 2025) starting. DM me and let me know you have ideas! We'll chat.
